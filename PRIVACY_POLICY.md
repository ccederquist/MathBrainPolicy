MathBrain is intended to be a small, simple game about learning to improve your mental math skills, and will not be doing any background data collection of any sort.

There is a leaderboard system that tracks your scores throughout the games within MathBrain, but it is only locally storing scores made on your device. Uninstalling the game or clearing your app data will erase all recorded leaderboard scores.

If MathBrain creates a security breach of any kind, or if you have any additional questions, please email me at the address below and I will try my best to help.
